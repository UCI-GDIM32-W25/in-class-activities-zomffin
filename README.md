# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Week 1
### Activity 1
Advice for Acing the Class: 

- LA tech support, office hours
- Be nice to LAs 
- Start assignments early
- Playtesting (CHECK YOUR itch.io LINK WORKS)
- Check resources, Unity documentation, forums, lecture slides

### Activity 2
1. x = 10
2. x = 2
3. Every frame prints "hello world" to the debug log.
4. MonoBehaviour
5. PrintMessage(10) is calling a function called PrintMessage and is passing in the integer 10. The method prints "x = 10".
6. (10) passes in an integer 10 to the function (argument), then the function adds the passed in integer into a string for the Debug.Log (parameter).
7. In the translate function, it's using the object class Transform.
8. It should be changed to _playerTransform.

I worked on getting the player jump to work right. I ended up doing a physics based jump since I made the ground a rigidbody for the player to sit on. I also had to remember the difference between OnTriggerEnter2D and OnCollisionEnter2D. I've been making a habit of using CompareTag on trigger checks but that doesn't work for the collision check.
